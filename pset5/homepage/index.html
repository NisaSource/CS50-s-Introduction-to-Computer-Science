            For me, pets are loyal friend. When we feel stressful, they will entertain us with their funny and silly behaviour. They boost our mood, help us remain fit and healthy, reduce our anxiety and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Different studies have determined that people who have the pet company in their home are less likely to develop mental health problems related to stress and depression. This fact becomes even more frequent among those who suffer from high-risk diseases such as AIDS or cancer.

          <p id="third">
            Pets always help establish relationships with other humans who also have pets. Whether in the park, on the ravine or even at the vet, pets are a good reason to chat with other people. This means a lot for all those people who suffer from shyness or more complicated problems such as social isolation or some types of phobia.
